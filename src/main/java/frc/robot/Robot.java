    // cycle, like a high precision control loop that is significantly affected by
    // the precise time that it is executed within each (usually 20ms) loop cycle.
    // 2. The sensor values used in the loop cannot be associated with timestamps in
    // an IO implementation. See solution #1.
    // 3. The IO (sensors, actuators, etc) involved in the loop are sufficiently
    // low-latency that the exact timestamp on the RIO is significant. For example,
    // CAN motor controllers are limited by the rate of their CAN frames, so the
    // extra precision on the RIO is insignificant in most cases.
